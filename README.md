# Movie-recommendation
Python code about choosing a movie recommendation based on the mood they select.

I have made this code using python topics such as functions as it is reusable and keeps my code clean and I don't need to write much.
I have also used dictonaries to write each mood and what movies that are for each mood for example happy : "Cars" this is an easy way distinguish the mood and movies.
